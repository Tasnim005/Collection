1
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,064
When I was young

2
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,880
I was a fool

3
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,128
I was blind, didn’t know any better

4
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:32,949
I was afraid I made too many mistakes

5
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:35,872
And You would only look at me as a sinner

6
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:39,620
No matter how much I tried

7
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:42,609
All the walls I put up always broke down

8
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:48,341
Until Your mercy overcame me

9
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,000
O Allah

10
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,872
You know all my

11
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:57,464
My insecurities

12
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:02,320
You keep them hidden away far away

13
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,345
O Allah

14
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:07,299
You hide all of my

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,722
Sins and impurities

16
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:15,656
You call me back when I stray

17
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,154
Whatever I have done

18
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,527
Whatever I have said, if it was wrong

19
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:22,143
It was only because I was tired of it

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,582
I thought I could do it all

21
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,137
That I was strong

22
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:29,036
But it turned out I wasn’t so clever

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,757
No matter how much I tried

24
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:35,904
All the walls I put up always broke down

25
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:41,517
Until Your mercy overcame me

26
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,084
O Allah

27
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:47,119
You know all my

28
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:50,650
My insecurities

29
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,506
You keep them hidden away far away

30
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,554
O Allah

31
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,595
You hide all of my

32
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,773
Sins and impurities

33
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:09,000
You call me back when I stray

34
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:15,132
Every time I think about Your blessings

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,848
I could never say thank you enough, even if I tried

36
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:26,599
If I praised You like the angels

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,231
Until the end of time

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,669
It’s not enough to

39
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:35,769
Earn all Your love

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,587
O Allah

41
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:40,677
You know all my

42
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,186
My insecurities

43
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:49,043
You keep them hidden away far away

44
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,114
O Allah

45
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,075
You hide all of my

46
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:57,407
Sins and impurities

47
00:02:57,997 --> 00:03:02,139
You call me back when I stray

48
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,211
O Allah

49
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,686
You know all my

50
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,881
My insecurities

51
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:15,616
You keep them hidden away far away

52
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:17,763
O Allah

53
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,743
You hide all of my

54
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,168
Sins and impurities

55
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:28,617
You call me back when I stray

56
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:30,775
O Allah
