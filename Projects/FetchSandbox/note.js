/*  The code you provided is using the JavaScript fetch function to make a network request to a JSON file located at "data.json". The fetch function returns a Promise which resolves with a Response object representing the response to the network request.

  In the second line of the code, json() is a method of the Response object. It is used to extract the JSON data from the response body as a JavaScript object.

  In the third line of the code, json is a parameter representing the parsed JSON data returned by the json() method. This parameter is passed to the second then method as the argument to its callback function. The purpose of this line is to log the parsed JSON data to the console.
  Overall, this code fetches JSON data from a file and logs it to the console.

/* When we say "parsed" JSON data, we mean that the JSON string has been converted into a JavaScript object that can be easily manipulated and accessed.

 When the JSON data is received from the network, it is in the form of a string, which needs to be parsed into a JavaScript object in order to be used in the code. The json() method of the Response object in the given code parses the JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object.

 Once the JSON data has been parsed into a JavaScript object, it can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation or bracket notation, just like any other JavaScript object. For example, if the JSON data contained an object with a key called name, we could access the value of that key using json.name.*/
