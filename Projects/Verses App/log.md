# Issues
**Needs to be Addressed**
- The button-container positioning in Quotes.html still requires adjustments for better alignment.
- Replace alert messages with in-DOM messages for a smoother user experience.
- Remove Bookmark Addition and display tab from the logged-out client view.

## Updates
- Minor modifications made across the app; no major updates to report.

## Resolved Issues
- Navbar height and background color have been resolved, with position: sticky applied across all pages for consistency.
- The button-container in Quotes.html has been moved outside the carousel and placed in a separate section due to positioning difficulties inside the carousel. This issue will be revisited in future updates.
- Slide transition timing for both index.html and quotes.html has been adjusted for smoother navigation.
