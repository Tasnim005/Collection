# Issues
**Needs to be Addressed**

- Fix background styling for the navbar in quotes.html.
- Replace alert messages with in-DOM messages for a smoother user experience.
- Remove Bookmark Addition and display tab from the logged-out client view.

# Updates
- **Quotes Page Implementation:**
Created quotes.html, quotes.css, and quotes.js files to build a new quotes page where users can add and view their personal quotes across devices. Authentication is enabled to allow quote access only for logged-in users.

- Designed a grid layout for displaying the user's quote collection.

## Resolved Issues
- Adjusted the width of input fields for mobile devices in auth.html for better responsiveness.

- Removed unnecessary list items (li) in the names.html file.
- Changed the background color of the Bookmark Addition tab for visual clarity.
