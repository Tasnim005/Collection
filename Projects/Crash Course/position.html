<!--
▪Position static: Is the default position for HTML elements, will not effect anything.

▪Position relative: Takes its initial position and can be translated from there on.

▪Position absolute: By default it is positioned relative to its closest ancestor (usually the body tag). If you define position relative on a parent element then it is going to be positioned in that context.

▪ Position fixed: Rips out the element from the document and fixes it to the viewport. 

▪ Position sticky: Switched between position static and fixed.
