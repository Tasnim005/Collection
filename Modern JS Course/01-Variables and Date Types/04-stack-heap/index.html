          The stack is a <span class="highlight">fixed-size memory</span> area
          used to
          <span class="highlight">store function calls and local variables</span
          >. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created. This stack
          frame contains the function's arguments, local variables, and the
          return address. When the function returns, its stack frame is popped
          off the stack. The stack is always
          <span class="highlight"
            >accessed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order</span
          >. This means that the most recently pushed item is always the first
          item to be popped off.

        <h1 class="title">Heap</h1>
        <p>
          The heap is a <span class="highlight">dynamic memory area</span> used
          to <span class="highlight">store objects and functions.</span> When an
          object is created, it is allocated space on the heap. When an object
          is no longer needed, its memory is garbage collected. The heap is
          <span class="highlight">accessed in a random order.</span> This means
          that there is no guarantee in which order objects will be allocated or
          garbage collected.

      <h2 class="title">A simple analogy</h2>
      <p>
        Think of the stack as a stack of trays. Each time you enter a cafeteria,
        you take a tray from the top of the stack and place it on the table.
        When you leave, you remove the tray and put it back on top of the stack.
        It's a <span class="highlight">temporary workspace with limited capacity</span>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Think of the heap as a storage area where you can place objects that you
        want to keep for an extended period. It's like <span class="highlight">renting a storage unit</span>
        where you can store items, and you need to remember to return the key
        when you're done.
