    <h1>Getters & Setters With Classes</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, getters and setters are special methods that allow you to
      define the behavior of reading and writing properties of an object. You
      can use getters to retrieve the value of a property, and setters to modify
      the value of a property. They are often used in classes to encapsulate the
      access to object properties.
