      <h1>Static Methods</h1>

      <p>
        In object-oriented programming, a static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. Unlike instance methods, which operate on instances of the class and have access to instance-specific data, static methods are associated with the class itself and do not have access to instance-specific data.</p>

        <ol>Here are some key characteristics of static methods:
          <li>Declared with the 'static' Keyword</li>
          <li>Accessed on the Class, Not Instances</li>
          <li>Since static methods are associated with the class, they do not have access to instance-specific data or properties. They can only access static properties and other static methods.</li>
          <li>Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't depend on the specific state of instances.</li>
          <li>They can also be used to create factory methods or perform operations that are not tied to a particular instance.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Here's an example in JavaScript:</p>

        <pre>
          <code>
  class MyClass {
     constructor() {
        // Instance-specific data
        this.instanceProperty = 'Instance-specific data';
        }
            
        // Instance method
        instanceMethod() {
          console.log('Instance method called');
        }
            
        // Static method
        static staticMethod() {
          console.log('Static method called');
          // Static methods cannot access instance-specific data
          // Uncommenting the next line would result in an error
          // console.log(this.instanceProperty); // Error
        }
  }
  
 // Creating an instance of MyClass
  const myInstance = new MyClass();
            
  // Calling the instance method
  myInstance.instanceMethod(); // Outputs: Instance method called
            
  // Calling the static method on the class itself
  MyClass.staticMethod(); // Outputs: Static method called
            
          </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>In this example, staticMethod is a static method, and it can be called on the class MyClass. Note that it does not have access to this.instanceProperty because static methods don't have access to instance-specific data.</p>
