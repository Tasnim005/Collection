      <h1>Getter and Setter Intro</h1>
      <h2>Getter</h2>
      <p>
        Getter is like asking a question. When you want to know the value of
        something, you ask a question (get information).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Imagine you have a Person object:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
    const person = {
      _name: 'John',
          
      get name() {
         return this._name;
      }
    };
          
    console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In this example, get name() is like asking, "What is the name of this
        person?" The name getter allows you to get the value of _name from the
        person object.
      </p>

      <h2>Setter</h2>
      <p>Setter is like giving a command. When you want to change something, you give a command (set a new value).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Continuing with the Person object:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
   const person = {
     _name: 'John',
          
      get name() {
        return this._name;
      },
            
      set name(newName) {
        this._name = newName;
      }
    };
          
    person.name = 'Jane';
    console.log(person.name); // Output: 'Jane'
                  
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>Here, set name(newName) is like giving the command, "Set the name of this person to a new value." The name setter allows you to change the value of _name in the person object.</p>

      <h2>Why use Getters and Setters?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Encapsulation: </b>Getters and setters help you control how values are accessed and modified, providing a level of protection for your data.</li>

        <li><b>Validation: </b>You can add checks or transformations when getting or setting values. For example, ensuring a name is always capitalized.</li>

        <li><b>Abstraction: </b>Getters and setters allow you to abstract away the internal implementation details of an object.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In summary, think of getters as a way to ask questions about the state of an object, and setters as a way to give commands to change that state. They provide a clean and controlled interface for interacting with your objects.</p>
