When I mention that private fields provide a high level of encapsulation and hide details from external code, I'm referring to the fact that external code cannot directly access or modify the private fields of the class. Let's explore this concept further:

In your `Wallet` class:

```javascript
class Wallet {
  #balance = 0;
  #transactions = [];

  // ... (rest of the class)

  get balance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }

  get transactions() {
    return this.#transactions;
  }
}
```

Here, `#balance` and `#transactions` are marked as private fields using the `#` symbol. This makes them inaccessible from outside the class, and external code cannot do the following:

```javascript
const wallet = new Wallet();

// This will result in an error because #balance is private
console.log(wallet.#balance);

// This will result in an error because #transactions is private
console.log(wallet.#transactions);
```

The private fields can only be accessed or modified from within the class methods, such as `deposit`, `withdraw`, `#processDeposit`, and `#processWithdraw`. External code can interact with the wallet only through the public methods and getters:

```javascript
const wallet = new Wallet();

// These are the only ways external code can interact with the wallet
wallet.deposit(500);
wallet.withdraw(100);
console.log(wallet.balance); // Getter for balance
console.log(wallet.transactions); // Getter for transactions
```

In this way, external code is prevented from directly manipulating the internal state of the `Wallet` instance. The encapsulation provides a level of abstraction, allowing you to control how the internal data is accessed and modified. If, in the future, you need to change the internal implementation (e.g., switch from an array to another data structure for transactions), you can do so without affecting external code that relies on the public interface provided by the class.

In summary, the use of private fields in this context ensures that the internal details of the `Wallet` class are hidden and can only be accessed or modified through well-defined public methods and getters, enhancing the principles of encapsulation and information hiding in object-oriented programming.
