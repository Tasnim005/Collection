The second process, where you expose properties directly and use methods for operations, does not have the same level of encapsulation as the first process with getters and setters. Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data and the methods that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class. The idea is to hide the internal details of an object and only expose what is necessary.

Let's analyze the level of encapsulation in both approaches:

### First Approach (Getters and Setters):

```javascript
class Wallet {
  // ... (unchanged)

  get balance() {
    return this._balance;
  }

  get transactions() {
    return this._transactions;
  }
}
```

- **Encapsulation:**
  - The internal details (the `_balance` and `_transactions` properties) are encapsulated within the class.
  - External access to these properties is controlled through getters, allowing you to control how the properties are accessed and potentially add logic in the future without changing the external interface.

### Second Approach (Direct Properties and Methods):

```javascript
class Wallet {
  // ... (unchanged)

  get finalBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }

  get transactionsRecord() {
    return this.transactions;
  }
}
```

- **Encapsulation:**
  - The internal details are exposed directly as public properties (`balance` and `transactions`).
  - External code can directly access and modify these properties without any control or validation from the class.

### Conclusion:

The first approach with getters provides a higher level of encapsulation because it allows you to control access to the internal state of the class. This encapsulation helps maintain a clear interface for external code and allows you to make changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code.

In the second approach, while you still have methods to perform operations, the internal state is directly accessible. This breaks the encapsulation principle to some extent because external code can access and modify the internal state without going through controlled access points.

In summary, if encapsulation is a priority, the first approach with getters and setters is generally preferable. It provides better control over how internal properties are accessed and modified from outside the class.
