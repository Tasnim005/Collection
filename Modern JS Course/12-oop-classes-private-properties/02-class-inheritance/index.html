      <h1>Class Inheritance</h1>

      <h2>Inheritance</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Definition: </b>Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented
        programming that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods
        of another class. The class that is inherited from is called the base
        class or parent class, and the class that inherits is called the derived
        class or subclass.
      </p>

      <h3>Demonstration in the Code:</h3>

      

      <pre>
        <code>
  class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(name, width, height) {
      super(name);
      this.width = width;
      this.height = height;
    }
  }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Rectangle class extends the Shape class, inheriting its properties
          and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          The super(name) line in the Rectangle constructor calls the
          constructor of the parent class (Shape), ensuring that the name
          property is properly initialized.
        </li>
        <li>
          The logName method of the Shape class is available to instances of
          Rectangle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now, when you create an instance of Rectangle and call logName, you get
        the behavior defined in the parent class:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  const rect = new Rectangle('Rect 1', 20, 20);
  rect.logName(); // Outputs: Shape Name: Rect 1

        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        This demonstrates inheritance, where the Rectangle class inherits the
        logName method from the Shape class and can also have its own additional
        properties and methods.
      </p>

      <h2>Polymorphism</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Definition: </b>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be
        treated as objects of a common base class. In other words, it allows a
        single interface to represent different types of objects.
      </p>

      <h3>Demonstration in the Code:</h3>

      <pre>
        <code>
  class Circle extends Shape {
    constructor(name, radius) {
      super(name);
      this.radius = radius;
    }

  // We can override the Shape logName() (polymorphism)
    logName() {
      console.log('Circle Name: ' + this.name);
    }
  }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>Polymorphism is demonstrated through the logName method.</li>
        <li>
          Both the Shape and Circle classes have a logName method. The Circle
          class overrides the logName method, providing its own implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you call logName on an instance of Circle, it displays a message
          specific to circles. This is an example of method overriding, which is
          a form of polymorphism.
        </li>
      </ul>
