# ES6 module syntax

ES6 module syntax is considered the modern and preferred syntax for handling modules in JavaScript and Node.js. ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced native support for modules, allowing developers to use the import and export statements for a more standardized and cleaner module system.

Here are some reasons why ES6 module syntax is preferred:

* **Consistency with Front-End Code:** The ES6 module syntax is the same syntax used in modern front-end development with tools like Webpack and Babel. Using a consistent module syntax across the entire development stack simplifies code sharing and understanding.

* **Static Analysis:** ES6 modules are statically analyzable, which means tools can efficiently determine dependencies at compile time. This allows for better optimizations and tooling support.

* **Named Exports and Default Exports:** ES6 modules support both named exports and default exports, providing flexibility in exposing multiple values or a single default value from a module.

* **Readability:** The syntax is often considered more readable and expressive, especially for modules that have multiple exports.

* **Tree-Shaking:** ES6 modules support tree-shaking, a process where unused exports are eliminated during the build, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

* **Dynamic Import:** ES6 modules support dynamic imports, allowing you to load modules asynchronously when needed.
