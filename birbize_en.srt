1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,589
We’re good, sir. Thank you very much.

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,509
We’re good too. You’re all in such a busy schedule.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,070
Yes, yes. The series are going really well.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,269
There’s a new song here.

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,710
ATV's two big hits. Yes.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,109
And we have a singer saying “Enough.”

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,990
Exactly. I said "Enough." Welcome.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,230
Yes Özge, let’s start with you.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,470
Welcome. After 6 seasons, we finally have you sitting here. We've been working for 6 seasons—how nice.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,310
We’re very busy, but 10 minutes... I know, I know.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,069
Welcome, Bala Hatun. Thank you. Yes.

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,150
So, it’s going intensely, huh?

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,510
Of course, with working 6 days a week, I joined you on my day off today.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,069
Thank you. Yes. And it’s your first series.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,470
While studying, I even have one and a half terms left.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,869
Well, when this opportunity came up, I found myself on this journey for 6 years.

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,270
How was it being in the lead role in your first series? It takes effort too.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,509
But you know, you don’t start in the lead role right away.
