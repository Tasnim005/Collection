      <h1>Event Loop</h1>
      <p>
        The Event Loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js that plays a crucial
        role in its <b>event-driven, non-blocking</b> architecture. Let's break
        down the key components to help you understand how it works.
      </p>
      <br />

      <div>
        <h2>1. Single-Threaded and Non-Blocking:</h2>
        <p>
          Node.js is <b>single-threaded</b>, meaning it uses a single thread to
          handle all operations. However, it employs an event-driven,
          non-blocking I/O model. This means that
          <i>instead of waiting for an I/O operation</i> (like reading from a
          file or making a network request) to complete, Node.js
          <b>continues to execute other tasks.</b>
          When the I/O operation is finished, a callback is triggered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>2. Event Loop:</h2>
        <p>
          The Event Loop is the core of Node.js's architecture. It
          <b
            >continuously checks the message queue for new events and executes
            associated callbacks.</b
          >
          Here's a simplified breakdown of the Event Loop:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Event Queue: </b
            ><b>Asynchronous events, such as I/O operations or timers</b> , are
            placed in the Event Queue when they are initiated.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Call Stack: </b>The Call Stack is where
            <b>synchronous code is executed</b>.
            <em
              >Each function call creates a stack frame, and when a function
              completes, its frame is removed from the stack.</em
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Callback Queue (or Task Queue): </b>When an asynchronous
            operation completes, its callback function is placed in the Callback
            Queue.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Event Loop:</b>The Event Loop
            <b>continuously checks the Callback Queue.</b> If the Call Stack is
            empty, it takes the first callback from the queue and pushes it onto
            the Call Stack for execution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>3. Example Scenario:</h2>
        <pre>
            <code>
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start reading file...');
                
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
        console.log('File content:', data);
});
                
console.log('File reading request initiated...');
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>In this example, the file reading operation is asynchronous. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>console.log('Start reading file...')</b> is added to the Call Stack and executed.</li>

            <li><b>fs.readFile(...)</b> is initiated, and its callback is placed in the Event Queue.</li>

            <li><b>console.log('File reading request initiated...')</b> is added to the Call Stack and executed.</li>

            <li>The file reading operation completes, and its callback is moved to the Callback Queue.</li>

            <li>The Event Loop checks the Callback Queue, finds the file reading callback, and pushes it onto the Call Stack for execution.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>4. Advantages:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Non-Blocking I/O: </b>While waiting for I/O operations, the single-threaded nature of Node.js can handle other tasks, improving overall efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>Scalability:</b>Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections without the need for multi-threading due to its non-blocking nature.</li>
        </ul>
