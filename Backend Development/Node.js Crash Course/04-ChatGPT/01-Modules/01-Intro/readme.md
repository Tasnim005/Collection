In Node.js, modules are a way to organize code into reusable files. They help break down large applications into smaller, manageable pieces. Understanding modules, the module.exports system, and the require function is fundamental for any Node.js developer.

# Modules in Node.js:
Definition: A module in Node.js is a file that contains JavaScript code, which can include functions, variables, and objects.

### Benefits:

* Encapsulation: Modules encapsulate code, preventing global scope pollution.
* Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of your application or even in different projects.
* Maintainability: Organizing code into modules improves the maintainability of your codebase.

## module.exports System:
### module.exports:
* In each module, there is a special object called module.exports. This object is initially an empty object.

* You can assign values, functions, or objects to module.exports to make them accessible outside the module.

* Whatever is assigned to module.exports becomes the "public interface" of the module.

# require Function:
Definition: The require function is used to include modules in your Node.js application. It reads the contents of the specified module file and returns its module.exports object.

### Basic Syntax:

```js
const myModule = require('./myModule')
```
* require takes a file path argument, which can be either a relative or absolute path to the module file.

* The file extension (.js) is optional.

* ./ denotes the current directory.
