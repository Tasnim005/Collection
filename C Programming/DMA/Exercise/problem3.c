/*
ðŸ”¶Problem 3: Dynamic Student Record System

**Description:**

* Use a struct to represent each student (e.g., `name`, `roll`, `CGPA`).
* Allocate space for `n` students using `malloc` or `calloc`.
* Allow the user to add/update/delete a student.
* Resize the array using `realloc` as new students are added.
* Free the memory at the end.

**Concepts Covered:**

* `malloc` or `calloc` for struct arrays
* `realloc` for growing the struct array
* `free` after done
* Simulates a real-world dynamic system
