/*
ðŸ”¶ Problem 2: Dynamic Array Initialization and Stats

**Description:**

* Ask the user how many integers they want to initialize to 0.
* Use `calloc` to allocate memory.
* Then ask the user to input only a few elements (leave the rest as 0).
* Print max, min, and sum.
* Reallocate to a new size and repeat.
* Free the memory at the end.

**Concepts Covered:**

* `calloc` initialization
* `realloc` resizing
* Partial data population
* `free`
