Got it — you want a **set of beginner-level C problems** that test fundamentals like:

✅ Data types & memory allocation
✅ Operators & expressions
✅ Basic input/output
✅ Control structures: `if-else`, `switch-case`, `nested if-else`

## 🔷 **Basic Programming Structures**

### Problem 1 — *Data types & size*

Write a program that prints the size (in bytes) of the following data types:

* `int`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`

Hint: Use `sizeof()` operator.

---


### Problem 3 — *Area & perimeter*

Write a program to:

* Take the radius of a circle from the user.
* Compute and print the area and circumference of the circle.

Use `3.1416` as π.

---

### Problem 4 — *Data types & overflow*

Write a program that assigns `32768` to a `short int` and prints the value.
What happens? Why? Print an explanation as a comment.

## 🔷 **Basic Input / Output**

### Problem 5 — *User details*

Write a program to:

* Take a user’s name, age, and GPA (on a scale of 4.0) as input.
* Print them in a nicely formatted way.

For example:

```
Name: Alice
Age: 20
GPA: 3.75
```

## 🔷 **Control Structures**


### Problem 10 — *Month name*

Write a program that:

* Takes an integer (1–12) representing a month.
* Prints the month name using `switch-case`.
* If out of range, print “Invalid month”.
